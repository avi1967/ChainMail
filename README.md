A beautiful, intentional Web3 application to **write anonymous, time-locked letters to future strangers** — built with 💖 using **Rust smart contracts**, **IPFS**, and a calming, pastel-themed UI.  
Whether you're writing to heal, share, or just be heard — ChainMail lets you connect across time.  
You send a letter. In 1 month or 1 year, it unlocks for someone random.  
When yours is unlocked, you receive one in return.  
You can’t send again until you reflect or reply. Slow. Serene. Human.

## 🙋‍♀️ Why This Project?

Modern digital communication is noisy, performative, and forgettable.  
**ChainMail** creates a calm, reflective space where users can:

* Be vulnerable without identity
* Communicate with strangers across time
* Participate in a slower, more meaningful digital ritual
* Embrace on-chain permanence for emotional authenticity

It’s **not just a dApp** — it’s a decentralized message-in-a-bottle 🌊.

## ✨ Future Ideas

* Email / push notifications when a letter unlocks
* Dark mode toggle 🌙
* Opt-in “Letter Garden” — public gallery of selected messages
* DAO for moderation and future features (ChronoDAO style)
* SBT or badge for message consistency and contribution
